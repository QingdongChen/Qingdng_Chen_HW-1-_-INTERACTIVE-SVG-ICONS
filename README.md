# Qingdng_Chen_HW-1_INTERACTIVE-SVG-ICONS

Add some simple interactivity with JavaScript.

## Usage

The usage of my design is that when the mouse is placed on the icon, it will change.

## Explain

I changed the size of my icons, so even though I set all the icons to be centered it may not look centered yet because I left some space for the icons that needed to be bigger, and when they got bigger they were centered.
